# Waldo Backend — Agent Orchestration

## Available Agents (invoke via Claude Code Agent tool)

### Planning
- **`planner`** — Phase planning, risk identification, task breakdown. Use before starting any sprint.
- **`workflow-mapper`** — Maps ALL data flow paths + failure modes BEFORE building. Run before any new EF or DO feature.

### Review (run before merging any PR)
- **`security-reviewer`** — Encryption, RLS, secrets, prompt injection, privacy. Run on any health data path change.
- **`health-data-reviewer`** — Null handling, personal baselines, Samsung HRV gap, edge cases.
- **`crs-validator`** — CRS algorithm validation against spec formulas. Run if touching `core/crs/`.
- **`soul-file-reviewer`** — Waldo's personality, conversation quality, medical claims. Run before any soul file deploy.

### Testing
- **`qa-breaker`** — Adversarial QA. Defaults to NEEDS WORK. Tries to break every feature.
- **`e2e-pipeline-tester`** — Full wearable → CRS → Claude → Channel Adapter pipeline.

## Dev-QA Loop (use for EVERY feature)

```
1. planner → task breakdown
2. [build]
3. qa-breaker → tries to break it
   PASS → advance
   FAIL (< 3 attempts) → fix, re-run qa-breaker
   FAIL (≥ 3 attempts) → escalate: decompose or defer
```

## Security Review Triggers (mandatory)

Run `security-reviewer` when touching:
- JWT validation, auth flows
- Health data access paths
- Supabase RLS policies
- CF DO memory writes
- Any new EF

## Skills (invoke with /skill-name)

- `/grill-me` — stress-test a design decision before building
- `/grill-with-docs` — grill using plan docs as source of truth
- `/tdd` — red-green-refactor loop for any new core logic
- `/diagnose` — root cause analysis for bugs and unexpected behavior
- `/zoom-out` — step back and evaluate if approach is right
- `/new-adapter` — scaffold a new adapter implementation
- `/check-contract` — verify code matches @waldo/types contract
- `/run-eval` — run the agent eval suite (tools/eval/run-suite.ts)
- `/write-a-skill` — create a new skill for this repo
