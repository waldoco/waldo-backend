## 21:28Z: handover pack, owner rulings, owner asleep

- **The owner went to sleep at about 21:27Z, after these instructions:**
  - coordinate every session to finish as much as possible tonight;
  - don't ask the owner questions;
  - sessions decide among themselves;
  - log everything;
  - where things are dire, copy what mature agent harnesses do.
- **Rulings recorded in `README.md`:**
  - 21:06Z: merge and deploy on the gate; the `v6` rename after a Simulator check; bounded email in meeting prep; Expo Push.
  - 21:20Z: merges apply to Ansh's PRs too; the app session runs on the owner's Mac; keep Patrol and Spots; a Mac email-and-calendar lane; follow Ansh's list for the design decisions; up to 5 test sends to the owner's own address.
- **Sessions tonight:**
  - **Orchestrator:** this session, `local_281f8c04`. It merges, deploys and runs Simulator QA on `iPhone 17`. Heartbeat cron `29a6d33d`.
  - **App:** a new session, `local_5eb95055-494e-44d2-88a9-47d493c751d7` ("Take over L4: Waldo app overnight build"), started from the old L4's card. It reports to the orchestrator and uses `iPhone 17 Pro`. The old L4 (`local_2c085cba`) has stopped taking work.
  - **Connectors:** the old L2 session (`local_83ce6587`) continues under `CONNECTORS.md`. No start-session tool exists, and `clear_session` works only on sessions this one started, so it keeps its context and relies on auto-compaction.
  - **Ansh's cloud backend lane and cloud orchestrator** work from #1103; the addendum is `ANSH_BACKEND.md`.
  - **The flaky-test session** (`local_7fe60b28`) has PR #1102 open, which goes through the gate.
  - **L1** (`local_63e9825d`) stands down; its deploy role is now the orchestrator's. **L3** stays parked.
- **Decisions on the owner's behalf:**
  1. **#1103 is the shared board for every session,** Mac included.
     - Why: the cloud sessions can't receive Mac messages.
     - To reverse: go back to #116 for the Mac lanes.
  2. **The design decisions R1–R14 follow Ansh's list wherever it covers them, keeping Patrol and Spots.** The rest wait for the owner.
     - This is the owner's 21:20Z ruling, relayed to the App session.
  3. **The orchestrator holds PR D's guard deletions or downgrades for the owner.**
     - Why: they change what blocks a merge, and posture.md treats process and security decisions as needing human-visible review.
